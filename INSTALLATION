This application was written for the Villa van Schaeck. Please contact me if you want to use it.

I have written this with Python 2.6.7, Django 1.3.1 and apache 2.2.21.

Installation (the method I've used)
* Make sure you have cloned this into a directory named 'vvs'
* Copy settings.py.example to settings.py and fill all settings marked with XXX
* Modify your apache configuration as stated below
* Initialize Django by calling `python manage.py syncdb`

Apache:
* You'll need mod_wsgi
	LoadModule wsgi_module        libexec/apache22/mod_wsgi.so
* Tell it where to find your clone but strip the remaining /vvs/
	<IfModule wsgi_module>
		WSGIPythonPath /path/to/your/basedir/
	</IfModule>
	# This would work if your clone is in /path/to/your/clone/vvs/
* Create a VirtualHost
	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerName zaalrooster.example.com
		ServerAdmin your@email.address

		Alias /media/ /path/to/your/basedir/vvs/media/
		Alias /static/ /path/to/your/basedir/vvs/static/

		WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/your/basedir/vvs/wsgi.py

		<Directory /path/to/your/basedir/vvs/>
			<Files wsgi.py>
				Order Deny,Allow
				Allow from all
			</Files>
		</Directory>
		<Directory /path/to/your/basedir/vvs/media/>
			Order Deny,Allow
			Allow from all
		</Directory>
		<Directory /path/to/your/basedir/vvs/static/>
			Order Deny,Allow
			Allow from all
		</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>
